📊 Exploratory Data Analysis of Supreme Court Decisions

Welcome to the GitHub repo for our project **"Exploratory Data Analysis of Supreme Court Decisions"** — a beginner-friendly deep dive into judicial data using Python. In this project, we analyze U.S. Supreme Court case data to uncover trends in decision types, voting behavior, and legal topics over time.

📌 What We Did

Using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, we:
- Cleaned and preprocessed court case data.
- Analyzed decision types (e.g., majority, unanimous).
- Visualized case trends across years and issue areas.
- Explored how justices vote and where they tend to agree or disagree.
- Identified outlier cases with extreme voting splits.

---

🎯 Key Insights

- Majority and unanimous decisions dominate, showing high agreement levels.
- Topics like **Criminal Law** and **Civil Rights** are the most frequently addressed.
- Some years see spikes in case volumes—likely tied to national events.
- Votes in controversial issue areas are more divided, revealing deeper ideological splits.
